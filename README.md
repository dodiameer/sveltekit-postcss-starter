# SvelteKit PostCSS Starter

This is meant to serve as a quick starter to be either used as-is or to add another CSS framework (Bootstrap, Bulma, Tailwind, etc.) to your project with the smallest configuration possible 

## Features

- PostCSS with
    - `autoprefix`
    - `cssnano` (Production only)
    - `purgecss` (Production only)
